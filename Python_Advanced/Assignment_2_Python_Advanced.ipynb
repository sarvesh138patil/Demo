    "    classes or just functions. If you need those classes or functions in your project, you just \n",
    "    import them. For instance, the math module in python contains just a bunch of functions, and \n",
    "    you just call those needed (math.sin).\n",
    "    On the other hand a python class is something similar to a java class, it's only structured in \n",

    "Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that an object of that class can have. It is the basic building block of object-oriented programming in Python.\n",

    "Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is created from the class blueprint and has its own unique set of attributes and methods. Objects are the entities that actually perform the actions in an object-oriented program.\n",

    "In order to comprehend Python OOP code, it is essential to understand how these two concepts work together. A class defines the structure and behavior of an object, while an object is an instance of that class with its own unique state and behavior. Understanding how to define and instantiate classes, as well as how to work with objects and their attributes and methods, is crucial for comprehending Python OOP code."
